# Hong Kong COVID19 Data
We are re-organizing the COVID19 reports from Data.GOV.HK (Hong Kong). You can find additional information [here](https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-dh-chpsebcddr-novel-infectious-agent). It's really critical to point out that we haven't yet performed proper validation on these data and would very much welcome contributors who are either interested in suggesting code changes, validating data, and/or contributing new data sets. In addition, please see the specific license, warranty, and copyright information for our code and each individual data set.
